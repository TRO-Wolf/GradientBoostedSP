## Project Description
This project was an attempt to build a forcasting model on the S&P 500
Tackling the equity market is a huge task which can require mass amounts of data.
The goal was to create a base line map of the equity markets so companies can keep 
track of current performance in an attempt to prepare both for expanding economic
cycles as well as contracting economic cycles
